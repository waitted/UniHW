def decode_digits(digits, bases):
1.for loop that gets a value of a digit multiplied by base to the power of its index, sums it with other digit-base pairs
returns the sum

def generate_digits(bases):
1. a list containing an empty list is created (the only way it works)
2. for every element of a base, a temporary list is created
2.1 for every element in the first list, for every value from 0 to base, the new list is appended with the value of the original list and the value
3. after the whole list was checked, it is replaced by the temporary list
returns the list

def find_doubles(bases):
1. a list of all possible bases is created (using generate_digits function), a count for a sum is created, a set and a dictionary
2. for every element in the list, sum is calculated using the decode_digits function (it is multiplied by the element of the base (of the same index) to the power of its index)
2.1. sum is added to the dictionary as a key, or if it is already present, the value for this key is changed by 1 
3. for every key in the dictionary, if its value is greater than 1, it is added to the set
return the set
